There is a Master's student in Applied Microbiology and Biological Engineering, an individual with a Master's degree in Electrical Engineering, an instructor in Aircraft Maintenance Technology, a PhD in water pollution control, and a Civil Engineering student. There are no direct conflicts, but the variety of fields and lack of direct matches to the original query introduce complexity.\\n\\n4. **Conclusion & recommendation**  \\n   Multiple candidates are plausible based on the search results. Human input is required to further narrow down the search based on specific criteria or additional information about the target individual.  \\n   **No reliable match yet.**  \\n   Recommendation: Gather more specific details about the target Yahya, such as his field of study or current projects, to refine the search.\"}}"
