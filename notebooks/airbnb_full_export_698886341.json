Very attentive, helpful, he seeks the well-being of others and puts you at ease. I rested well in peace while enjoying Tangier serenely. I intend to go back. Good places should be kept. I would highly recommend it."

From the time of booking, he was very available by phone, always ready to guide me and answer all my questions with kindness. The accommodation was impeccable: very clean, well maintained, and exactly as described. The location is ideal, easily accessible by public transport, with all the shops and very good places to eat a stone's throw away. It was a real pleasure to stay here, I highly recommend this place to anyone looking to have a good time in Tangier. Congratulations to Hassan for his professionalism, his sense of service and the quality of his accommodation!"
